# About
Gamebits should be an online social platform focused on providing a safe place for everyone who enjoy videogames to share bits of their experiences and achievements in different worlds in videogames. The platform should offer Sign Up functionality, Sign In functionality, and provide the users with the possibility of creating posts, liking posts, comment on posts, follow other users, filter posts by liked posts, posts by followed users, search specific posts by name, key words in their content and/or game. Users should also be able to create small threads of comments to continue their conversation and be able to collapse these comments to better view the entire comment section. Furthermore, each time a user posts something, receive likes or is followed by other users, they will receive a certain, undefined amount of experience points so they are awarded correctly for providing good content for the platform. Doing so will achieve them by increasing in levels and users will be displayed on a future leaderboard page with the entire of users of the page in order from the highest to the lowest, so higher leveled users are easier to find and be appreciated, even though this doesn't mean that lower leveled users are obscured. Each time a user receives a like, a comment under their own post or comment, when a user follows them or when they level up, they will receive a notification on their future applied Notifications page.

# User Experience Design
## Strategy
The platform is designed to be easy to use and intuitive for anyone that would like to use the platform, not only people interested in videogames. The main goal of the page is to offer a place to share your gaming bits of experiences and cool moments with anyone and share that special moment with as many people as possible. As a final goal, the page was aiming at increasing the positive feedback and social communication and sharing experience in any gaming community.
