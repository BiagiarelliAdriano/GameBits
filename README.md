# About
Gamebits should be an online social platform focused on providing a safe place for everyone who enjoy videogames to share bits of their experiences and achievements in different worlds in videogames. The platform should offer Sign Up functionality, Sign In functionality, and provide the users with the possibility of creating posts, liking posts, comment on posts, follow other users, filter posts by liked posts, posts by followed users, search specific posts by name, key words in their content and/or game. Users should also be able to create small threads of comments to continue their conversation and be able to collapse these comments to better view the entire comment section. Furthermore, each time a user posts something, receive likes or is followed by other users, they will receive a certain, undefined amount of experience points so they are awarded correctly for providing good content for the platform. Doing so will achieve them by increasing in levels and users will be displayed on a future leaderboard page with the entire of users of the page in order from the highest to the lowest, so higher leveled users are easier to find and be appreciated, even though this doesn't mean that lower leveled users are obscured. Each time a user receives a like, a comment under their own post or comment, when a user follows them or when they level up, they will receive a notification on their future applied Notifications page.

# User Experience Design
## Strategy
The platform is designed to be easy to use and intuitive for anyone that would like to use the platform, not only people interested in videogames. The main goal of the page is to offer a place to share your gaming bits of experiences and cool moments with anyone and share that special moment with as many people as possible. As a final goal, the page was aiming at increasing the positive feedback and social communication and sharing experience in any gaming community.

### Color palette
The following color palette was chosen for the website. The colors were chosen with the strategy to present a more modern color scheme, with darker colors for backgrounds and bright neon lights and colors for the details.

## User stories
I started out my project by mapping out all of the different features my page should have had. Starting with User Stories, with prioritization from Must-have to Could-have, present in the GitHub repository:
[User Stories.](https://github.com/BiagiarelliAdriano/GameBits/issues?page=1)
Most of the Backend functionalities described in the User stories were actually implemented and are present in the final project. Many of the Frontend side of the functionalities were unfortunately not implemented due to timing issues and several bugs and errors, so they are either not present or not fully functional.
